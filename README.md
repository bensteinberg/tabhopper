#Tabhopper
A basic add-on for moving quickly through tabs

Default distance to hop is 5; change it in the add-on's preferences.

The hotkey is like the normal hotkey for traversing tabs, with the addition of alt aka option -- that is, "accel-alt-shift-]" and "accel-alt-shift-[" where accel means Cmd on a Mac and Ctrl on Windows and Linux.
